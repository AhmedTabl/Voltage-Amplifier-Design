# Voltage_Amplifier_Design
This project involves the design and simulation of a CE-CE-CC (Common Emitter-Common Collector) multistage inverting amplifier using Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJTs). It was developed to meet specific power, gain, and frequency response requirements, with theoretical analysis and performance validation through Multisim simulations.
